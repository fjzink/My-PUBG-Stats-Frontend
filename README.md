# React Boilerplate
This is my boilerplate set up for a React app bundled with Webpack with some of the basic dependencies needed for React. This project is set up to bundle your css into modules, and is set up with the `sass-loader` to process sass files.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo to your local machine. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```git clone https://github.com/fjzink/react-boilerplate.git```


2. Install the dependencies with your package manager of choice.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```yarn install```


3. There are scripts to run the development server and to create an optimized production build. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To start the development server run the `start` script:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```yarn start```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create a production build of the react app, run the `build` script:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```yarn build```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will create a `dist/` folder in the root directory of the project if it does not already exist and output your bundled project files into this folder.
