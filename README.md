# My PUBG Stats
Do you want to know how well you have been playing on PUBG? Do you want to brag to your friends about your KD ratio or your longest kill? My PUBG Stats is a web app and community for PUBG where you can analyze your game statistics. You can search a gamertag to find player stats for a given season, and there are plans to add additional features such as viewing your recent matches and chat rooms for players to discuss game balancing, new maps, etc.

## Motivation
I am a gamer and PUBG is one of my favorite games. One day I was searching for a cool API to build a project with and I saw that PUBG has a public API. This got me excited to work with an API for one of my favorite games and it inspired me to create this web app for players to look up game statistics. I really enjoy being able to look up statistics on games that I play so I wanted to create a web app that I would enjoy using and that other people would love to use as well.

## How It Works
You can search for player statistics by gamertag, platform, and region. There are different regions for PC and Xbox so once you select the platform you can then select from the appropriate regions.
