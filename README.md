# React Boilerplate
This is my boilerplate set up for a React app bundled with Webpack with some of the basic dependencies needed for React. This project is set up to bundle your css into modules, and is set up with the `sass-loader` to process sass files.

## Usage

Clone the repo to your local machine. 


```
git clone https://github.com/fjzink/react-boilerplate.git
```
